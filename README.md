**You can exclude some npm dependencies with install-subset when you don't need them**.

Consider:
- A CI server for your builds: you may not need your linting or testing tools. With a busy or shared server, you can save precious time.
- A data generation library you only need once.
- Toolsets that only a certain team member needs or uses, depending on their job, IDE or preferences.

Even with npm 5 and yarn, **installing node modules can be a long and painful task**. Sometimes you have to build a native bindings like node-sass or couchbase, and sometimes you just have 100,000 dependencies. You are at the mercy of:
- your connection speed & latency
- your computer's willingness to cooperate
- the number of dependencies
- the [disk space available](http://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/August2017/node-modules.jpg)
- your patience

## Installation

`npm install -g install-subset`

## Usage
Add something like this to your package.json:
```
"subsets": {
  "build": {
    "include": [
      "babel-cli",
      "dotenv",
      "webpack"
    ]
  },
  "test": {
    "exclude": [
      "eslint",
      "prettier"
    ]
  },
  "container": {
    "exclude": [
      "nativescript",
      "serverless",
      "ngrok"
    ]
  }
}
```

In your terminal: `$ subset install test`

This installs all of your application `dependencies`, excluding eslint and prettier, which are listed under your `devDependencies`. 

If you would like install-subset to consider all of the dependencies of your application when evaluating subsets...

In your terminal: `$ subset install container --all`

## Case Study

[fakeit](https://github.com/bentonam/fakeit) is an amazing fake data generation library with support for couchbase, complicated related data models, multiple export options and more. However, its dependency tree is large, and has a dependency on a native Couchbase binary. In an example React Native project, just excluding this one rarely used devDependency cuts install time by around 29 seconds.
